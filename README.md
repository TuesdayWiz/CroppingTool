# CroppingTool
A tool that detects and crops around a face in a user-uploaded photo.  Originally designed to crop passport photos according to [US Government specifications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html) because their [photo tool](https://tsg.phototool.state.gov/photo) sucks.

## Features
- Allows users to use their own photos
- If multiple faces are found, lets the user select which face to crop to
- Alerts the user if no faces are found
- Exports the cropped image to a location of the user's choice
